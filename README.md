# AlarmKlok
Simple (dumb) python/tkinter alarm clock.

* Buttons for incrementing and decrementing the alarm time require pics I have on my comp, just replace with text.
* Use "File->Exit" to quit the program, I use some multi-threading in the GUI (traditionally not good for tkinter) and it throws errors when you quit via the "X" button in the top right corner of the window (for windows machines)
